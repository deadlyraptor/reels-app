## reels-app

A suite of helps that streamlines processes at Coral Gables Art Cinema and AFI

This is an improved version of [reels](https://github.com/deadlyraptor/reels),
which consisted of several Python scripts requiring users to install Python
on their workstations. reels-app is run on the Heroku hobby tier.
